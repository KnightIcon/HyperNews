Some data files are too large to upload to github, so we upload them to the Baidu Netdisk which can be download from "https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lVdaM4zxhFS35gzLjsUtzQ" by the code "7ge9".
Raw dataset could be download from "http://reclab.idi.ntnu.no/dataset/" while details of news articles should email author of this paper(The Adressa dataset for news recommendation) to acquire.
